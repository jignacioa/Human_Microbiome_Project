# Human Microbiome Project

Data for the analysis was obtained through the Human Microbiome Project, a National Institute of Health (NIH) project that aims to characterize the human microbiome with the purpose of understanding the relationship between microbial communities in our bodies and their role in human health and disease.

The dataset labeled projects as 'Complete' and 'In Progress' so after analyzing and summarizing interesting insights into the projects, a logistic regression model was trained to predict project completion.
